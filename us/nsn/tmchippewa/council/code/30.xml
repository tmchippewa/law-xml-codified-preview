    <heading>Turtle Mountain Chippewa Water Act</heading>
    <text>"The water spirits are in all water everywhere. Our Creation story states that when Gitchi Manitou breathed life into the water, he placed the water spirits there to help protect it. We are being repeatedly warned about the damage we are inflicting on the water. By banning fracking, the Turtle Mountain Reservation is doing their part to be good stewards of the water." – Bob Shimek, Chippewa leader living on the White Earth Reservation</text>

      <text>Nibi (water) is sacred and is vital to all life within the environment, including human life and especially to the lives of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians. Gichi Manitou, in our Creation Story, breathed life into Nibi, our water, and gave us the water spirits to guide our actions and to protect the water. Our traditional teachers reveal that the Chippewa women were given the responsibility for protecting the water. To honor that role, the women will lead water ceremonies and to promote tribal water standards outlined in the TMBCI Water Act. These guiding principals have led to the following declarations.</text>

      <heading>Jurisdiction</heading>
      <text>All waters reserved, including but not limited to, the Treaty at Prairie du Chien between the Chippewa and the Sioux, August 19, 1825, and the Treaty at the Old Crossing of the Red Lake River, between the United States and the Red Lake and Pembina Band of Chippewa, October 2, 1863 and Executive Orders of December 21, 1882, March 29, 1884 and June 3, 1884, Government Document No. 444, Senate Report 693, 56th Cong. 1st Session., are held by the United States in trust, and ownership is held by the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa for the inalienable use and benefit of the Tribe and its members.</text>
      <text>The Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa invokes the Winters Doctrine as part of their claim to jurisdiction over tribal waters. The judicially crafted Winters Doctrine (1908) provides water for the needs of Native Americans who reside on federally reserved lands. The decision is one of the Supreme Court's foremost Indian law decisions and a landmark for water law. The Court held that when an Indian reservation is established, water rights accompany creation of the Indian homeland; water rights are reserved for the tribe.</text>
      <text>On November 22, 2011, the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Tribal Council unanimously voted to ban Hydraulic Fracturing and was signed into law on the 29<sup>th</sup> day of November, 2011.</text>
      <text>The McCumber Agreement of 1892, between the TMBCI and the Federal Government our ancestors, recognized the importance of our natural resources for our future generations.</text>
      <text>Article III:  The land, woods, and waters above reserved for the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians, subject to the stipulations contained in Article II of this treaty and agreement shall be held as common property of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians...by enacting this water act, tribal leaders are upholding the intent of our ancestors.</text>

      <heading>Findings</heading>
      <text>The Tribe finds and declares:</text>
      <text>The quality of all waters of the Tribe will be protected for the use and enjoyment by the people of the Tribe.</text>
      <text>The management and protection of water is a central attribute of tribal sovereignty and is vital to the well-being of its inhabitants.</text>
      <text>Water has cultural, spiritual, social, environmental, health, and economic values that require protection and we must guide the appropriate use and management of all resources affecting the watershed and drainage basins of the Reservation and its allotted lands.</text>
      <text>All water is interconnected by the hydrologic cycle of tribal lands and each watershed is consequently a unitary resource, whether occurring as surface water or ground water, spring water or mineral water, soil moisture, precipitation, atmospheric, percolating or non-percolating, recharge, drainage waters, overflow, and waters associated with mineral and/or petroleum resources.</text>
      <text>The Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa are interconnected to the environment and to the integrity of the ecosystem, including but not limited to the fish, wildlife, plants, trees and the environment.</text>
      <text>In 1987, the EPA amended the 1972 Clean Water Act to treat tribal governments the same way it treats states. Among other things, this meant that tribal governments were given the power to create their own water quality standards with federal approval. Like the regulations imposed on states, these tribal standards must be equal to or more stringent than federal standards. It is the Tribes intent to exercise its sovereign authority.</text>
      <text>It is the right of the Tribe to maintain the quality and composition of the water to sustain life systems and their protection with regards to contamination, for renewal of the life of Mother Earth and all its components.</text>

    <text>"Access to fresh, clean water is one of our most basic human rights granted to us from the Creator, and is an 'inherent' right handed down to us throughout the generations from our Anishinabe ancestors from time immemorial.  These inherent rights woven throughout the fabric of Anishinabe culture and life ways, and, told to us through our oral history and legends, our songs and our art are what make us a 'Tribe'. These gifts were acknowledged by our people long before the Europeans came to Turtle Island, and long before we were forced into giving up our traditional homelands under duress, and into making treaties, now considered to be the Supreme Law of the Land.  We have a duty, a responsibility to protect this sacred connection to Water, not only for ourselves, but for our future generations to come.   Our survival as a Tribe depends on conserving and protecting our Water."  Deborah LaVallie</text>

Where water is absent, so is life.  Midewiiwin teaching.  Tom Davis</em></text>
