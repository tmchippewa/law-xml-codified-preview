        <text>Subject to Subsection (b), the measure of damages for non-acceptance or repudiation by the buyer is the difference between the market price at the time and place for tender and the unpaid contract price, together with any incidental damages, but less expenses saved in consequence of the buyer's breach.</text>

        <text>If the measure of damages provided in Subsection (a) is inadequate to put the seller in as good a position as performance would have done, then the measure of damages is the profit which the seller would have made from full performance by the buyer, together with any incidental damages incurred.</text>
