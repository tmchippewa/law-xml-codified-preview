      <text>Subject to the provisions of Sections 4.0512, "Oral disclosure", and 4.0513, "Third party may intervene", the disclosure is conclusive as to all property of defendant. If the garnishee denies having any indebtedness to the defendant or having any property of the defendant in possession, the filing in court of a copy of the disclosure operates as a full discharge of the garnishee at the end of twenty (20) days from date of service of the disclosure, in the absence of further proceedings as provided for in Sections 12, "Oral disclosure", and 13, "Third party may intervene". The filing of objections to the disclosure or the filing of any motion or other proceedings operates as a stay of the discharge. The court may, upon proper showing, relieve the plaintiff from the operation of the discharge after the expiration of twenty (20) days. The garnishee may be discharged where the value of the property of defendant held or indebtedness owing to defendant is less than ten (10) dollars, and the garnishee may apply to the court to be discharged as to any property or indebtedness in excess of the amount which may be required to satisfy plaintiff's judgment.</text>

If the garnishee holds the garnished property by a title that is void as to the defendant's creditors, the garnishee may be charged for the property although the defendant could not have maintained an action against the garnishee for it; but in this, and in all other cases where the garnishee denies liability, the plaintiff may move the court at any time before the garnishee is discharged, on notice to both the defendant and the garnishee, for leave to file a supplemental complaint making the garnishee a party to the action, and setting forth the facts upon which the plaintiff claims to charge the garnishee. If probable cause is shown, the motion shall be granted. The supplemental complaint must be served upon both defendant and garnishee, either or both of whom may answer, and the plaintiff may reply. The issues must be brought to trial and tried as in other actions.</text>

      <heading>Judgment Against Garnishee</heading>
      <text>Judgment against a garnishee shall be rendered, if at all, for the amount due the defendant or so much thereof as may be necessary to satisfy the plaintiff's judgment against the defendant, with costs taxed and allowed in the proceedings against the garnishee but not to exceed one hundred ten percent (110%) of the amount which remains unpaid. The judgment shall discharge the garnishee from all claims of all the parties named in the process to the property or money paid, delivered, or accounted for by the garnishee by force of the judgment. When any person is charged as garnishee by reason of any property in possession other than an indebtedness payable in money, that person shall deliver the property, or so much thereof as may be necessary, to the plaintiff holding execution, and the property shall be sold and the proceeds accounted for in the same manner as if it had been taken on execution against the defendant. The garnishee shall not be compelled to deliver any specific articles at any time or place other than as stipulated in the contract with the defendant.</text>
