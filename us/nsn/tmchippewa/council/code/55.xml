        <text>Purpose – The first purpose of <cite path="55">this title</cite> is to memorialize the procedures used by the Tribe to determine what services or programs are needed to promote public health, safety and other basic need services for the promotion of the general welfare of the Tribe such as sewer, water, electrical service / power, infrastructure, housing, public sanitation services, public education and other such functions that support the long historical and cultural general welfare of the Tribe.

        <text>Intent - The Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians ("Tribe"), a federally recognized Indian Tribe, exercises its inherent rights of sovereignty to promote the general welfare of the Tribe, its self- determination, culture, and tradition, by providing general welfare assistance, including Indian general welfare benefits within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code Section 139E. Both the United States Congress, through its enactment of the Tribal General Welfare Exclusion Act of 2014, and the Internal Revenue Service, through its traditional application of the general welfare doctrine, have long recognized the sovereign right of Indian tribal governments to provide financial assistance to individuals under certain circumstances on a non-taxable basis. <cite path="55">This title</cite> is intended to affirm the Tribe's inherent sovereign rights to promote the general welfare of the Tribe and provide qualifying assistance and program benefits on a tax free basis. In this regard, the <cite doc="Turtle Mountain Constitution and By-laws">Constitution of the Tribe</cite> confirms the sovereign duty and responsibility of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians to maintain the culture and independence of its members, to encourage the economic well-being of its members, and to promote the rights of its members and their common welfare. The Assistance authorized by <cite path="55">this title</cite> is intended to qualify for tax free treatment to the fullest extent permitted at law. Without limitation, the following benefits shall be treated as non-taxable hereunder:</text>
        <para>
          <num>(1)</num>
          <text>Benefits that satisfy the requirements for exemption under Code Section 139E;</text>

          <text>Benefits that meet another express exemption under the Internal Revenue Code, such as the exemption provided for tribal medical expenses under Internal Revenue Code Section 139D, or that meet other recognized exemptions including, for, example, resource or land-based exemptions under 25 U.S.C.

      <heading>Programs Meeting the General Test</heading>
      <text>Programs that do not qualify for non-taxable treatment under IRS Code Section 139E or under an IRS Safe Harbor, will nonetheless be treated as non-taxable if Program benefits meet the General Test for treatment under the General Welfare Exclusion. For purposes of the General Test only, needs must be shown in one of the following manners:</text>
      <para>
        <num>(a)</num>
        <text>Individual Needs. Certain Programs may be based on individual need, rather than an overall need of the Tribe. For those Programs, the Tribal Council may establish income guidelines unique to the Tribe or may use readily available income guidelines used by state or federal programs to demonstrate individual or family need. When individual or family need must be shown, the Program may take into account individual circumstances or extraordinary need to overcome presumptions based on income alone.</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>(b)</num>
        <text>Community Needs. Certain Programs may be based on community needs, which are so important to the self-nation culture and traditions of the Tribe that Assistance may be deemed necessary regardless of individual income or wealth. For example, states provide public education to all citizens regardless of individual income or wealth. Some Programs may address both individual and community-based needs. The Council reserves the right to require any applicant applying for consideration based on non-financial or community-based needs to demonstrate how the Program benefits will benefit the tribal community as a whole, including preservation of culture, tradition and self-determination. Approval based on non-financial need criteria is made on a facts and circumstances basis and will be guided by traditional values and culture. A Program will be deemed to be based on community or non-financial needs if so designated by the Council.</text>

The Tribal Council shall establish objectives for the furtherance of the general welfare, self- determination, culture and tradition of the Tribe and assess progress on said objectives in connection with its budgeting and/or strategic planning process. Approved Programs shall be renewed, established, modified, or terminated based upon the needs of the Tribe as compared to the objectives set by the Council from time to time hereunder. All Programs hereunder shall provide a social benefit for the promotion of the general welfare of the Tribe and be limited to purposes consistent with treatment under <cite path="55">this title</cite>. Such purposes may include, for example, and not by way of limitation, assistance for medical care, food, shelter, health, education, subsistence, housing, elder and disabled care, assistance to meet cultural, traditional and religious needs of the Tribe and its membership, and assistance to promote self-sufficiency, self-determination, Tribal image, entrepreneurship, and the employment of Tribal Members. Designation by the Tribal Council of a Program as falling under <cite path="55">this title</cite> shall be conclusive evidence that the Tribal Council, following a good faith review of Tribal needs and goals, has determined that said Program is established to achieve a social benefit and to promote the general welfare of the Tribe.</text>

      <text>Coordination with IRS and the United States Treasury Department on General Welfare matters shall be grounded on a government-to-government relationship that recognizes the unique relationship between the federal government and the Tribal government. The federal government, as a result of its treaty obligations and trust responsibility, has committed to providing education, housing, clean water, and many other basic needs for Indian people. Through a conscientious shift in policy in recent decades, the federal government has encouraged the Tribe itself to provide for such needs in partnership with the federal government and, increasingly in recent years, instead of the federal government. Essential to the government-to-government relationship is mutual respect and deference to Tribal governance decisions. Future consultations on General Welfare matters should reflect these concerns and the fact that the Tribal government, through its own policy setting process, is best situated to determine the needs of the Tribe and its Members and the appropriate policy solutions. All references to Executive Order 13175 shall include any future amendments thereto.</text>
