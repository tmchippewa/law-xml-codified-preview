      <text>This Children's Code shall be construed to effectuate the following public purposes:</text>
      <text>It is our conviction that protection of the Children of Turtle Mountain Chippewa Tribe is primarily the responsibility of the parents; and if, for whatever reason, parents falter, and children or the Tribal Community are exposed to harmful situations or actually harmed, the Tribe must intervene to correct the situation and protect the child. The purpose of this Code shall be to protect our children through stabilizing and strengthening families whenever possible, to assure the safety and welfare of the children, and to protect the peace and security of the community.</text>
