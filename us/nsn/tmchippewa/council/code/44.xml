        <text>The flood hazard areas on the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation (and surrounding Indian trust lands) are subject to periodic inundation which can endanger life, result in loss of property, create health and safety hazards, disrupt commerce and governmental services, and cause extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.</text>
