As used in <cite path="38.02">this Chapter</cite> the word "drug" means any drug or substance or combination of drugs or substances which renders a person incapable of safely driving, and the words "chemical test" or chemical analysis" means any test to determine the alcoholic, or drug, or combination thereof, content of the blood, breath, or urine, approved by the state toxicologist under <cite path="38.02">this Chapter</cite>. The test or tests must be administered at the direction of a law enforcement officer only after placing the person, except persons mentioned in <cite path="38|38.02|38.0213">Section 38.0213</cite> under arrest and informing that the person is or will be charged with the offense of driving or being in actual physical control of a vehicle upon the public highways under the influence of intoxicating liquor, drugs, or a combination thereof. For the purposes of <cite path="38.02">this chapter</cite>, the taking of custody of a child as defined under <cite path="5|5.10|5.102">Section 5.102</cite>(1) satisfies the requirement of an arrest. The law enforcement officer shall also inform the charged that refusal of the person to submit to the test determined appropriate will result in a revocation for up to three of the person's driving privileges. The law enforcement officer shall determine which of the tests is to be used. When a child is taken into custody for violating <cite path="38|38.02|38.0208">Section 38.0208</cite> or an equivalent ordinance, the law enforcement officer shall diligently attempt to contact the child's parent or legal guardian to explain the cause for the custody and the implied consent chemical testing requirements. Neither the law enforcement officer's efforts to contact, nor any consultation with, a parent or legal guardian may be permitted to interfere with the administration of chemical testing requirements <cite path="38.02">this Chapter</cite>.</text>

A person may not be required to submit to a screening test or tests of breath while at a hospital as a patient if the medical practitioner in immediate charge of the person's case is not first notified of the proposal to make the requirement, or objects to the test or tests on the ground that such would be prejudicial to the proper care of treatment of the patient. The screening test or tests must be performed by an enforcement officer certified as a chemical test operator by the state toxicologist and according to methods and with devices approved by the state toxicologist. The results of such screening test must be used only for determining whether or not a further test shall be given under the provisions of <cite path="38|38.02|38.0210">Section 38.0210</cite>.  The officer shall inform the person that refusal of the person to submit to a screening test will result in a revocation for up to three years of that person's driving privileges. If such person refuses to submit to such screening test or tests, none may be given, but such refusal is sufficient cause to revoke such person's license or permit to drive in the same manner as provided in <cite path="38|38.02|38.0216">Section 38.0216</cite> and a hearing as provided in <cite path="38|38.02|38.0218">Section 38.0218</cite> and a judicial review as provided in <cite path="38|38.02|38.0219">Section38.0219</cite> must be available. However, the commissioner must not revoke a person's driving privileges for refusing to submit to a screening test requested under <cite path="38|38.02|38.0226">this section</cite> if the person provides a sufficient breath, blood, or urine sample for a chemical test requested under <cite path="38|38.02|38.0210">Section 38.0210</cite> for the same incident. No provisions of <cite path="38|38.02|38.0226">this Section</cite> may supercede any provisions of <cite path="38.02">this Chapter</cite>, nor may any provision of <cite path="38.02">this chapter</cite> be construed to supersede <cite path="38|38.02|38.0226">this section</cite> except as</text>
      <text>provided herein. For the purposes of <cite path="38|38.02|38.0226">this section</cite>, "Chemical test operator" means a person. certified by the state toxicologist as qualified to perform analysis for alcohol in a person's blood, breath, saliva, or urine.</text>
