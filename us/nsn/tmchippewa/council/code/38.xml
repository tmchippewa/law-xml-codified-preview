      <heading>State Toxicologist to Examine Specimens of Fatalities in Accidental Deaths Involving a Motor Vehicle; Record Use</heading>
      <text>In cases of death resulting from a motor vehicle accident or other unnatural death occurring in a motor vehicle, the coroner shall require that specimens of blood, urine, and vitreous humor be withdrawn from the body of the decedent within twenty-four hours after his death by a coroner, coroner's physician, or other qualified person, prior to embalming. The specimens must be collected and preserved by methods and techniques established by the state toxicologist. The specimens so drawn must be sent to the state toxicologist for analysis for alcohol, carbon monoxide, and other drug content. The state toxicologist shall keep a record of all such examinations to be used for statistical purposes. The records must be made available to the director for use by the national highway traffic safety administration in analyzing fatal accidents. The information in the possession of the director may be obtained from the state toxicologist only as provided in <cite path="§38.02.250">this section</cite>. Except as provided, the results of the examinations referred to in <cite path="§38.02.250">this section</cite> must be used only for statistical purposes, except that the results must be released upon the issuance of a subpoena duces tecum by a court of competent jurisdiction in any civil or criminal action. The cumulative results of the examinations, without identifying the individuals involved, must be disseminated to interested state and local officials and made public by the state toxicologist. Any person drawing the specimens and any person making any examination under the terms of <cite path="§38.02.250">this section</cite> are immune from all liability, civil or criminal, that might otherwise be incurred or imposed.  The individual drawing the specimens must be paid a fee of five dollars by the state toxicologist for each acceptable specimen submitted for analysis under the requirements of <cite path="§38.02.250">this section</cite>.</text>

      <heading>Screening Test</heading>
      <text>Any person who operates a motor vehicle upon the public highways of the Turtle Mountain Reservation is deemed to have given consent to submit to an onsite screening test or tests of the person's breath for the purpose of estimating the alcohol content of the person's blood upon the request of a law enforcement officer who has reason to believe that the person committed a moving traffic violation or was involved in a traffic accident as a driver, and in conjunction with the violation or the accident the officer has,  through the officer's observation, formulated an opinion that the person's body contains alcohol. A person may not be required to submit to a screening test or tests of breath while at a hospital as a patient if the medical practitioner in immediate charge of the person's case is not first notified of the proposal to make the requirement, or objects to the test or tests on the ground that such would be prejudicial to the proper care of treatment of the patient. The screening test or tests must be performed by an enforcement officer certified as a chemical test operator by the state toxicologist and according to methods and with devices approved by the state toxicologist. The results of such screening test must be used only for determining whether or not a further test shall be given under the provisions of <cite path="§38.02.100">Section 38.02.100</cite>.  The officer shall inform the person that refusal of the person to submit to a screening test will result in a revocation for up to three years of that person's driving privileges. If such person refuses to submit to such screening test or tests, none may be given, but such refusal is sufficient cause to revoke such person's license or permit to drive in the same manner as provided in <cite path="§38.02.160">Section 38.02.160</cite> and a hearing as provided in <cite path="§38.02.180">Section 38.02.180</cite> and a judicial review as provided in <cite path="§38.02.190">Section 38.02.190</cite> must be available. However, the commissioner must not revoke a person's driving privileges for refusing to submit to a screening test requested under <cite path="§38.02.260">this section</cite> if the person provides a sufficient breath, blood, or urine sample for a chemical test requested under <cite path="§38.02.100">Section 38.02.100</cite> for the same incident. No provisions of <cite path="§38.02.260">this section</cite> may supercede any provisions of <cite path="38.02">this chapter</cite>, nor may any provision of <cite path="38.02">this chapter</cite> be construed to supersede <cite path="§38.02.260">this section</cite> except as provided herein. For the purposes of <cite path="§38.02.260">this section</cite>, "Chemical test operator" means a person. certified by the state toxicologist as qualified to perform analysis for alcohol in a person's blood, breath, saliva, or urine.</text>
