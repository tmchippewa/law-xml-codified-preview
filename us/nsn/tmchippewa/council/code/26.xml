        <text>No person may be convicted of an offense unless each element of the offense is proved beyond a reasonable doubt. A person is presumed innocent until proven guilty. The fact that a person has been arrested, confined, or charged with the offense gives rise to no inference of guilt at his <u>his/her Tribal Court procedure</u>.  "Element of an offense" means:</text>
        <para>

          <text>the forbidden conduct;</text>

      </para>
      <para>
        <num>(c)</num>
        <text>Unless it is otherwise provided or the context plainly requires otherwise, if an offense outside <cite path="26">this title</cite> defining an offense, or a related statute, or rule or regulation thereunder, contains a provision constituting an exception from criminal liability for conduct which would otherwise be included within the prohibition of the offense, that the defendant came within such exception is a defense. Subsection (a) does not apply to any defense which is explicitly designated an "affirmative defense." An affirmative defense must be proven by the defendant by a preponderance of evidence.</text>

      <para>
        <num>(d)</num>
        <text>When a statute establishes a presumption, it has the following consequences:</text>
        <para>
          <num>(1)</num>
          <text>If there is sufficient evidence of the facts which gave rise to the presumption, the presumed fact is deemed sufficiently proved to warrant submission of the issue to a jury unless the court is satisfied that the evidence as a whole clearly <u>refuted</u> the presumed fact.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <num>(2)</num>
          <text>In submitting the issue of the existence of the presumed fact to a jury, the court shall charge that, although the evidence as a whole must establish the presumed fact beyond a reasonable doubt, the jury may arrive at that judgment on the basis of the presumption alone,  since the law regards the facts giving rise to the presumption as strong evidence or the fact presumed.</text>
        </para>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>(e)</num>
        <text>When a statute declares that given facts constitute a prima facie case, proof of such facts warrants submission of a case to the jury with the usual instructions on burden of proof and without additional instructions attributing any special probative force to the facts proved.</text>
