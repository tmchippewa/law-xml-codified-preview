      <text>The grandparents and great-grandparents of an unmarried minor child may be granted reasonable and balanced visitation rights to the child by the tribal court upon a finding that visitation would be in the best interests of the child and would not adversely interfere with the parent-child relationship.</text>
      <text>The tribal court shall consider the amount of the personal contact that has occurred between the grandparents or great-grandparents and the child and the child's parents.</text>
      <text>The burden to show that it is in the best interest of the child(ren) to have some visitation and some quality time with their grandparents lies with the grandparents by clear and convincing evidence and the grandparents also must show by clear and convincing evidence that such grandparent visitation would not adversely interfere with the parent-child relationship.</text>
      <text>Grandparent visitation is a matter of how much and how the visitation is going to be structured; and, that the Tribal Court(s) may not award visitation unless a parent has denied (or unreasonably denied) visitation to the concerned third party (i.e. grandparents) and parties involved have first gone to mediation or arbitration.</text>
      <text>The subordinate right of the grandparents under Turtle Mountain traditional law to have visitation with their grandchildren, regardless of which parent has custody of the child(ren), and regardless of whether the parents are together or not is hereby recognized and affirmed.</text>

      <heading>Domestic Relations</heading>
      <text>The Turtle Mountain Tribal Code does not currently address the issue of the subordinate right of grandparents to visit their grandchild(ren) and the Tribe takes into consideration that if too many third parties are allowed to dilute the superior right of the parent(s) to care, custody, and control of their children, then such tribal interference would be contrary to the federal constitution; and therefore, third parties (i.e. grandparents) cannot be allowed to rely solely on the best interests of the child(ren) analysis to dilute and compete with fundamental, paramount, and superior parental rights.</text>
      <text>Should a parent or other custodian of a child wish to disallow a child's grandparents from exercising the subordinate right recognized in <cite path="§9.02.160">Section 9.02.160</cite> above, the grandparents must first argue their subordinate right to visitation through mediation and show, by clear and convincing evidence, that the grandparents are not a threat to the physical and/or moral health and welfare of the child and that such grandparent visitation would not adversely interfere with the parent-child relationship.</text>
      <text>The Tribal Court shall require mediation of the matter under <cite path="9.02">this chapter</cite> before such a matter is brought to Tribal Court.  If mediation fails and if the mediator agrees, the court may order the dispute arbitrated by the person who attempted mediation.  Joinder of grandparents or of great grandparents awarded visitation rights under <cite path="§9.02.170">this section</cite> must occur in any proceeding to terminate parental rights.</text>
      <text><cite path="§9.02.170">This section</cite> does not apply to agency adoptions or when the child has been adopted by a person other than a stepparent or grandparent.  Any visitation rights granted under <cite path="§9.02.170">this section</cite> before the adoption of the child may be terminated upon the adoption if termination of the rights is in the best interest of the child.</text>
      <text>An application for visitation rights under <cite path="§9.02.170">this section</cite> may be considered by the tribal court in conjunction with a divorce proceeding involving the parent of the minor child.  If any tribal court retains jurisdiction over the residential placement of the minor child or children by virtue of any prior proceeding, the rights conferred by <cite path="§9.02.170">this section</cite> maybe enforced by the grandparents or the great-grandparents through motion under the prior proceeding.  If no tribal court otherwise has jurisdiction, a proceeding to enforce grandparental visitation rights may be brought against the parent having primary residential responsibility as a civil action and venued in the county of residence of the minor child.</text>

        <text>Petition for restoration of parental rights. Any time after one year after the execution of a relinquishment or issuance of a decree of voluntary termination of parental rights, if the child as to whom parental rights were relinquished or terminated has neither been adopted nor is in an adoptive placement, the parent whose rights were relinquished or terminated may petition the Tribal Court for restoration of parental rights. However, upon fifteen days notice to the petitioners and the Court having jurisdiction of the petition, and unless otherwise ordered by the Court, an agency may place a child for adoption during the pendency of the petition and such placement will have the effect of terminating the petition. In the case of an adoptive placement made during the pendency of such a petition, the prospective adoptive parent(s) with whom the child is placed shall be notified by the agency of the petition prior to placement.</text>

      <heading>Child Support</heading>
      <text>Preamble. It is the policy of the Judicial Branch of Government of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa to pronounce that every parent owes a duty to his/her child to provide support. Every child has a right to support from their parent whether or not the parent is present or absent. This right to support cannot be abrogated by agreement of the parents by contract, settlement or stipulation in any court decree. Furthermore, as a matter of law, it is proclaimed to be in the best interest of children to be supported by their parents. Support payments established by the Judicial Branch of Government under this policy are deemed minimums. Payments for the support of children may exceed these standards based upon the parent's ability to pay but may not be less than those payment levels established under this policy. Actual cash payments are based upon the parent's ability to pay as determined by their net income with allowances for authorized adjustments and special consideration that the court may find appropriate. Furthermore, it is expressly understood that support payments may be further reduced by the provision of clothing, food or other item necessary for the maintenance of the child by the parent required to pay child support as provided in these under this policy.</text>

Income of a remarried parents spouse is not income for the purpose of <cite path="§9.08.090">this section</cite>. Furthermore, the income of the custodial spouse will not be considered in any manner to reduce the obligation of support of the non-custodial parent.</text>

        <text>Child support obligation shall be 15% of the parent's net income if support is sought for one child, nineteen percent (19%) if supporting two children, and three percent (3%) additional for each additional child. Examples include a absent parent supporting one child will be required to pay 15% of their income to support that child A parent supporting two children, 19% of their net income, three children, 22% of their net income, four children 25% of their net income, five children 28% of their net income, six children 31% of their net income, seven children 34% of their net income, eight children 35% of their net income, nine children 35% of their net income, etc. These percentages shall not be diminished due to remarriage or the parenting of other children. The above percentage may be reduced in any month in which the parent to whom child support is ordered furnishes things necessary for the child such as clothing, food or other item. This reduction, however, shall not exceed 20% of the total cash obligation of the parent. When all of the children to which support is being sought are from the same family, the maximum net income subject to child support shall be 35%. When support is sought for children from more than one family, the maximum net income subject to child support shall be 50% with all first children of each family being financially supported equally. The first child in each family will be supported at 10% of net income. This example will result in 20% of net income assessed for two children in separate families with each child supported at 10%, three children in separate families, 30% of net income with each child supported at 10% etc. For each additional child in the same family, an additional 4% of net income will be assessed for child support for that family.</text>

        <text>This Act shall be known as the Turtle Mountain Child Support Enforcement Act. It is designed to regulate the establishment of paternity, the setting of child support obligations and the enforcement of those obligations in the tribal court. This Act reflects the sovereign right of the Turtle Mountain Chippewa Tribe to determine its own internal relations, as well as the rights of those non-members who enter into consensual relations with tribal members or others located on the Turtle Mountain reservation. It also reflects the Tribe's intent to operate its own child support enforcement program under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act.</text>

It is the purpose of this Act to provide a manner in which paternity can be established, thus allowing children the opportunity to identify with their natural parents and enjoy the benefits associated with enrollment into the. It also reflects the intent of the Turtle Mountain Tribe to provide for adequate child support for all children who are members or eligible for membership with the Tribe, or those children found upon the Turtle Mountain reservation, while recognizing the severe economic conditions facing many absent parents who strive to support their children.</text>

        <text>Statute of Limitations. Paternity may be established in an action brought in the Turtle Mountain Tribal Court by the natural mother, putative father, or custodian or guardian until the child reaches the age of 18 years. Any action previously barred by tribal statute of limitations less than 18 years may also be maintained under <cite path="§9.08.110">this section</cite> provided the cause of action accrued less than 18 years from the time of filing. A child may bring an action to establish paternity at any time within the child's life for the limited purpose of establishing enrollment with the Tribe. This action may be brought against the putative father or the estate of the putative father if deceased, but any finding of the Court with regard to paternity shall only impact the child's eligibility for enrollment and will not support the reopening of any concluded probate proceedings or any action for back child support.
