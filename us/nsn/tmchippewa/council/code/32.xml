      <heading>Findings</heading>
      <text>It is the policy of the Turtle Mountain Tribal Council to promote employment opportunities for Indians and business opportunities for Indian firms and contractors, and to provide direction, management and business standards for the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation.  The work force of the Tribe must be given an opportunity to gain employment on or off the reservation and the Tribal council will promote that preference in harmony with congressional enactments giving Indians special employment rights.  It is also the Council's responsibility to monitor Indian preference along with collecting from those doing business on the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation a fair fee for that privilege.  Thus, the Tribal Council has enacted and hereby amends an ordinance called "Tribal Employment Rights Ordinance (TERO)."</text>

      <heading>Minimum Numerical Goals and Timetables for Indian Employment</heading>
      <text>The Commission will establish the minimum number of Indians, which is set at seventy-five (75%) percent each employer should employ on his work force during any year that he or any of his employees are located or engaged in work on the reservation or Tribal adjacent land.  Noncompliance will require rational between employer and Commission.  Numerical goals shall be set for each craft, skill area, classification, etc., used by the employer and shall include, but not be limited to, administrators, supervisory, and professional categories.  The goals shall be expressed in terms of number of Indian employment as a percentage of the total man hours worked by the employer's workforce in the job classification involved.  Numerical goals shall be based upon surveys of the available Indian manpower pool and of projected employment opportunities.  Both the TERO Director and the License Compliance/Employment Officer shall be involved in the formation of hiring goals for each employer.</text>

        <text>For new employer, the goals shall meet with the Commission or Director as long before he actually begins work as possible and shall furnish the Commission with a precise list of the number, the kind of employees he expects to employ.  The Commission or Director shall then set specific goals and timetables for the employer after considering any special factors or goals into his plan for complying with this Ordinance and shall agree in writing to meet these goals.  Any employer who fails to provide such a written agreement to the TERO Commission shall not be permitted to commence work on the reservation.</text>

The employer shall incorporate the goals into his plan for complying with this Ordinance and shall agree in writing to meet these goals.  Any employer who fails to provide such a written statement will not be permitted to commence work on the reservation.  The TERO Commission shall maintain on file the current plan of each employer authorized to undertake work on the reservation.</text>

      <para>
        <num>(c)</num>
        <text>For both new and existing employers, the goals shall be reviewed by the Commission at least annually and shall be revised as necessary to reflect changes in the number of Indians available or changes in employer hiring plans.  Each employer shall submit a monthly report to the Director on a form provided by the employer, indicating the number of Indians in his work force, how close he is to meeting his goals, all persons hired or fired during the month, the job positions involved and other information required by the Commission.</text>

The Commission shall bear the initial burden of providing that an employer has failed to or is failing to meet its goals.  Upon a prima facie proof of such failure, the employer shall then bear the burden of proving that it has met or is meeting its goals or has made a good faith effort to meet its goals.  It shall not be an excuse for such failure that the union with which the employer has a collective bargaining agreement providing for exclusive referral failed to refer Indians.</text>

      <heading>Tribal Hiring Hall</heading>
      <text>The Commission shall establish and administer a tribal hiring hall to assist employers in identifying and hiring qualified Indians in job positions, employ and supervise a License Compliance/Employment Officer to oversee the hiring hall, labor survey, and employee referral functions under this ordinance.  An employer may recruit and hire workers from whatever sources are available to it and by whatever process it chooses, provided that it may not hire a non-Indian until it has given the Commission or Director a reasonable time to locate a qualified Indian and the tribal hiring hall has certified that a qualified Indian is unavailable to fill the vacant job position.</text>
      <text>For purpose of this Ordinance, "reasonable time" shall be defined as follows:  Three (3) working days to locate and refer a qualified Indian.  The Commission may grant a waiver of these time periods upon a showing by the employer that such time periods impose an undue burden upon it.  An employer subject to a collective bargaining agreement with the union shall be exempt from this procedure if the union agrees to refer Indians from a listing supplied by the Commission or Director.  However, if any union fails to meet this obligation to refer Indians to an employer, the Commission or Director may require the employer to accept Indian referrals from sources other than the union.</text>
      <text>In administering a tribal hiring hall, a hiring list may be maintained by the License Compliance/Employment Officer.  Individuals who desire to obtain employment in areas within the scope of this TERO Ordinance may enter their names on this hiring list.  Names shall be entered in chronological order by the date and time of sign-up.  The list may be utilized by the License Compliance/Employment Officer on a first come, first served basis in placing individuals of comparable skills in various crafts with various employers:  Comparably skilled individuals shall be referred for placement in the order their names appear on the list.</text>
      <text>If any non-Indian worker is found to be employed in a job in violation of <cite path="ยง32.04.060">this section</cite>, the employer shall be required by the Commission or Director to remove employee immediately and said employer shall be subject to the penalties in <cite path="32.08">Chapter 32.08</cite> of this Ordinance.</text>
