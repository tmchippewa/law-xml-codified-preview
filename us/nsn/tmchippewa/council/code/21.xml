        <text>Sovereign Power to Regulate Utilities. The power to regulate all public utilities is an inherent and essential part of the authority of any American Indian Reservation tribal government. This power is an aspect of the retained sovereignty of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians, an American Indian Tribe, limited only to the extent that such power has been specifically limited or withdrawn by federal law.</text>

        <text>Need For Adequate Utility Regulations. As both the Indian and non-Indian populations within the boundaries of the Reservation increase, and as additional residential, commercial, governmental and agricultural activities multiply, the need for adequate utility regulations grows ever more serious. Inasmuch as the Reservation is checker boarded with both trust land and non-trust land, and inasmuch as both trust land and non-trust land are crisscrossed by electric lines, telephone lines, pipelines, rail lines and rights of way of both investor-owned and nonprofit utilities, adequate protection of utilities, the Tribe, tribal members and nonmembers requires that the Tribe regulate all utilities operating within the Reservation.</text>

      <para>
        <num>(f)</num>
        <text>Demonstrably Serious impact of Utility Activities. Upon the Economic Security, Health and Welfare of the Tribe and Tribal Members. The rural nature of the Reservation causes the development and maintenance of all public utilities within the Reservation to be more difficult and expensive than in urban areas of the United States. It is in the best interest of all members of the Tribe to assure the fair and equitable delivery of all 'public utility service to every member of the Tribe throughout the entire jurisdictional area of the Turtle Mountain Indian Band. The need for regulatory and/or ownership control over the various public utilities servicing the Reservation is enhanced by the fact that many homes of tribal members, especially HUD financed homes, are located in diverse rural sites; that many of these homes are "all electric," that is, heated solely by electricity; that there is a very limited supply of other practical heat sources for many tribal members and nonmembers; that the health and very lives of many tribal members and nonmembers are dependent upon an assured flow of electricity and access to telephone communications during the harsh, sub-zero winter months regularly experience on the Reservation; that there is a lack of practical transportation for many elderly tribal members and nonmembers during the harsh, subzero winter months; that tribal economic enterprises which are dependent upon access to public utilities, furnish the majority of jobs for both tribal members and nonmembers on the Reservation-all combine to make the regulation of the supply and delivery of public utility services of prime governmental importance to the people and business located within the jurisdictional boundaries of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians. And all evidence the demonstrably serious impact of utility activities upon the economic security, health and welfare of the Tribe, tribal enterprises and tribal members.</text>

        <text>State Jurisdiction. The State of North Dakota lacks jurisdiction to regulate utilities within the Reservation for the reason that state regulation of such utilities directly interferes with the right of the Tribe and tribal members to make their own laws and be governed by them. State regulatory interest is also preempted by the Tribe and the federal government with respect to all homes and businesses of tribal members financed in whole or in part by the Tribe or the federal government, all tribal buildings and businesses of the Tribe financed in whole or in part by the Tribe or the federal government and all Bureau of Indian Affairs or other federally owned or operated buildings.</text>

        <text>Need to Designate Service Area Boundaries of Public Utilities. The absent of Tribal regulation of the development and service of public utilities has resulted in a total failure to make any overall designation of service territory area boundaries for any of the public utilities servicing the Reservation. This has resulted in some instances, in the wasteful duplication of investment in facilities and service of utilities, while at the same time, some areas of the Reservation go with less than adequate facilities necessary to support existing and future development. Tribal members, Tribal enterprises and the Tribe must bear the ultimate cost of such duplication and lack of full area development and access.</text>

        <text>Illegal Collection of State Taxes By Utilities. Despite the fact that both tribal members, Tribal enterprises and the Tribe are each exempt from state taxes for all utility services Provided them within the Reservation, The Commission herein created shall police the collection of state gross receipts taxes, excise taxes and state income tax upon the business activities of public utilities with respect to services provided to tribal members, tribal enterprises and the Tribe within the Reservation. Such collection of state tax cannot be expected to stop unless tribal regulation identifies such practices and prohibits the continuance of such practices when found to be illegal.</text>

        <text>Consensual Relations Between Utilities Operating within the Reservation and the Tribe, Tribal Members and Nonmembers. The Council finds that every public utility which enters and operates within the Reservation, enters into consensual relations, commercial dealings and contracts with residents of the Reservation, Indian and non-Indian, and with the Tribe, to provide services, operate facilities, construct and erect pipelines, transmission lines, poles, towers and other improvements upon and across Reservation lands owned by Indians, non-Indians and the Tribe. The Council further finds that the services, rates, policies, procedures and practices of every utility located and operating upon the Reservation have a demonstrably serious impact which has the potential to imperil the economic security, health, welfare and general well-being of the Tribe, its members, and all residents of the Reservation and that regulation of every such utility by the Tribe is a necessary and proper exercise of the sovereign authority of the Tribe to limit exposure of the Tribe, its business enterprises and its membership from the risk of such peril. The Council further finds that regulation of such utilities located, operating or providing services upon the Reservation is an essential governmental function of the Tribe and that regulation of every such utility located, operating or providing services upon the Reservation by any State or any municipality or political subdivision of a State is an infringement upon the right of the Tribe to make its own laws and be governed by them and demonstrably imperils the political integrity and right of self-government of the Tribe.</text>

      <text>The Council hereby declares it to be in the public interest that all utilities located, operating or providing services within the Reservation to be regulated as hereinafter provided in order to provide all retail consumers of utility services and commodities within the Reservation with adequate and reliable services at reasonable rates, consistent with the financial and economic requirements of such utilities and their need to construct facilities to provide such services and commodities or otherwise to obtain utility supplies, to avoid unnecessary duplication of facilities which increase the costs of service to the consumer and to minimize disputes between utilities which may result in inconvenience or diminished efficiency in service to such consumers. The purpose of this legislation shall also be to regulate all utility policies located, operating or providing services within the Reservation with respect to matters other than rates, including connection of service, disconnection of service, re-connection, deposit and overdue payment charges and to Prohibit discriminatory or unreasonable preferences or advantages to any consumer or group of consumers by providers of utility services. The regulation of utilities within the Reservation by the Tribe pursuant to <cite path="21">this title</cite> shall be deemed exclusive and shall preempt all other regulatory authority with respect to all utilities located, operating or providing services within the Reservation.</text>

      <heading>Valuation of Utility Property</heading>
      <text>For the purpose of assessing property for taxation purposes, the Commission may employ such persons or firms to determine the valuation of the property (including necessary rights-of-ways, rolling stock, and capital improvements) which belong to each of the public utilities doing business within the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation and its Trust Lands. Such valuation may be relied upon by the Tribal Council in determining a fair and equitable level of taxation to be based upon such valuation, the gross revenues derived therefrom, or the going concern value of each utility operations within the Reservation.</text>
