        <text>Our traditional foods are derived from the plant, fish, and animal beings living within the Ceded Territories, given as gifts by Gichi-Manidoo, and thus are integral to the spiritual and cultural identity of the Anishinaabeg. Access to these traditional foods, for all Anishinaabeg, is critical for our survival, to decrease incidents of chronic disease and to achieve overall wellness. Without the continued availability of plants, fishes, and animals, the Anishinaabeg would cease to be as Gichi-Manidoo made us.</text>

Such food safety hazards can be introduced both within and outside the processing plant environment, including food safety hazards that can occur before, during and after entry into the food processing environment. A food safety hazard that is reasonably likely to occur is one for which a prudent processor would establish controls because experience, illness, data, scientific reports or other information provide a basis to conclude that there is a reasonable possibility that the hazard will occur in the particular type of product being processed, in absence of those controls.</text>

        <text><cite path="58.08">This chapter</cite> applies to the production of low-risk foods. Low-risk foods are foods that carry a lower risk of food-borne pathogens and can be safely produced outside of tribally-licensed food processing plants. A non-exclusive list of low-risk foods includes: manoomin (wild rice) and manoomin flours, low-acid fruit preserves, low-acid pickled produce, dried teas or dried tea blends, dried fruit (excepting melons), candy, syrups and sugar made from tree sap.</text>

        <text>A valid low-risk food vendor license issued by the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians is required for the production of low-risk foods produced outside of a tribally-licensed food processing plant, except that Class 1 manoomin and Class 1 syrup and sugar may be processed without a low-risk food vendor license. Low-risk food vendor licenses shall be issued upon the submission of complete applications and satisfactory inspection. Low-risk food vendor licenses may be revoked or suspended for non-compliance with the standards set forth within <cite path="58.08">this chapter</cite>. The TMBCI tribal licensing authority may refuse to issue a low-risk food vendor license to an individual with ownership or management interest in an operation which has been subject to any serious, or ongoing or unresolved violations of any applicable portions of <cite path="58">this title</cite>. An application for a low-risk food vendor permit must be submitted to the TMBCI tribal licensing authority annually, for each physical location used to produce a low-risk food, containing the following information will be located in TMBCI Policy and Regulations.</text>
