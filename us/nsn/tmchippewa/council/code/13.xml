Along with the right to elect, is the right to refer to the voters any enacted or proposed resolution or ordinance; propose constitutional amendments; and to recall any representative who has demonstrated the inability or unwillingness to carry out their elected responsibility. The following process is adopted to protect these rights. The following process is not designed to be used as a manner of harassing, vexing or annoying an elected official nor an elected government. It shall be the right of any Qualified Voter to petition the Turtle Mountain Tribal Court any time they may believe that this process is being utilized for any reason not consistent with <cite path="§13.12.010">this section</cite>, for a determination of that issue. If the Turtle Mountain Tribal Court determines, after notice and hearing, that the process is being used for a purpose inconsistent with <cite path="§13.12.010">this section</cite>, it may enjoin the petitioners from further proceeding with such action.</text>

      <text>The right of the enrolled members of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians to elect representatives to protect and promote the best interests of all Tribal members is an important right.

The following process is adopted to protect these rights. The process is not designed to be used as a manner of harassing, vexing or annoying an elected official nor an elected government. In order to ensure an orderly hearing and to ensure that the individual subject to the removal proceeding receives their due process rights, pursuant to <cite doc="Turtle Mountain Constitution and By-laws" path="VIII|2">Article VIII, Section 2, of the Tribal Constitution</cite> and in accordance with <cite path="§13.13.010">this section</cite> of the Tribal Code, the following procedures that will be employed at the Tribal Council meeting assembled for removal purposes.</text>
