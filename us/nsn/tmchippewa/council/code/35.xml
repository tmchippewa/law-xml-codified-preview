      <heading>Statements of Tribal Policy and Legislative Intent</heading>
      <text>Pursuant to the power vested in it by the <cite doc="Turtle Mountain Constitution and By-laws">Constitution of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians</cite>, the Tribal Council, recognizing the spiritual, cultural, and economic value of the wildlife and recreation resources of the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation and Trust Lands held in trust for its members; and recognizing that these are irreplaceable Tribal resources; and recognizing that unregulated use of the wildlife and recreation resources of the Tribe would threaten the political integrity, the economic security, and the health and welfare of the Turtle Mountain Tribe and its members, hereby enacts this Game and Fish Code to ensure proper management of these vital resources.</text>
      <text>Further, recognizing that the Turtle Mountain Chippewa people alone have the absolute, inherent, retained sovereign right to use and enjoy its natural resources, and to govern its use by its Members and all others, the Tribal Council, in regulating the wildlife and recreation resources of the Reservation, intends that tribal Members shall be afforded the greatest possible freedom to use and enjoy these resources consistent with the preservation and improvement of these resources for future generations.</text>
      <text>Of secondary importance is the policy of permitting the limited use of the wildlife and recreation resources of the Reservation and trust lands by Non-members for the promotion of intercultural education and good will and for the economic benefit of the Tribe as a whole. Recognizing the Turtle Mountain Chippewa tradition of restitution as a remedy for injustices, the Tribal Council hereby declares that this Code is civil in nature and that restitution and other civil penalties shall be the primary remedy for its violation. Criminal sanctions may also be imposed in cases where this Code so provides.</text>

        <text>The Department shall prepare and at least once per year shall review and, as necessary, revise a schedule of Liquidated Damages calculated to closely approximate the cost of providing equitable restitution to the Tribe for the damage which would be caused by each violation of each regulation of this Code. In calculating these Liquidated Damages the Department may consider, in addition to any other factors reasonably deemed relevant:</text>

      <heading>Liquidated Damages Presumption</heading>
      <para>
        <num>(a)</num>
        <text>Since in most instances the exact amount of damages caused to the Tribe by a particular violation of this Code will be difficult or impossible to determine, it shall be presumed by the court adjudicating a complaint for violation of this Code that the amount fixed by the schedule of Liquidated Damages represents the damages owed to the Tribe as restitution if the defendant is found to be liable. This presumption may be rebutted by evidence which shows by clear and convincing evidence that the amount indicated by the schedule of Liquidated Damages is so excessive in a particular case as to be punitive, or so inadequate in a particular case as to result in a gross deprivation of adequate restitution. In any case in which the presumption is successfully rebutted, the parties may introduce evidence to prove the actual damages as in any other civil case.</text>

        <text>Nothing in this Code shall be deemed to preclude the Tribe, through its counsel, from praying for and being awarded punitive damages in any civil action filed for a violation of this Code wherein it is alleged that the violator has committed the acts constituting the violation without regard to the interests of the Tribe or wantonly, willfully or maliciously.</text>
