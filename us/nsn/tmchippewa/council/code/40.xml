      <heading>Summary of the Penalty Calculation System for Administrative and Civil Penalty Policy</heading>
      <text>The Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians (TMBCI) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) TMBCI/EPA penalty calculation system established under this Administrative and Civil Penalty Policy ("Policy") shall be applicable to the penalties assessed pursuant to Title 40 TMBCI Solid and Hazardous Waste Management Code (SHWMC). This policy shall be applied for all calculated penalties that are over $100.00, or where a penalty amount is not specified by Title 40 TMBCI Solid and Hazardous Waste Management Code (SHWMC) or policy (see Appendix A. for standard/specified administrative penalties or fines). Appeals of assessed administrative penalties/fines at or below $200.00, or as specified in Appendix A, is limited to the TMBCI/EPA Director or Tribal Solid Waste Management Team (TSWMT) designated for first level of appeal and may</text>
      <text>not be appealed to Tribal Court. Under This Policy, the seriousness of the</text>
      <text>violation and any good faith efforts to comply with applicable Tribal requirements are to be considered in assessing a penalty. This Penalty Policy consists of:</text>

      <heading>Establishment of Penalty Calculation Methodology</heading>
      <text>More specifically, this Penalty Policy establishes the following penalty calculation methodology:</text>
      <text>Penalty amount = gravity-based + multi day +/- adjustments + economic benefit component</text>
      <text>In administrative civil penalty cases, the TMBCI/EPA will perform two separate calculations under this Policy:</text>
      <para>
        <num>(1)</num>
        <text>to	determine	an	appropriate	amount	to	seek	in	the	administrative complaint	and	subsequent			litigation,	and</text>
        <para>
          <num>(2)</num>
          <text>to explain and document the process by which the Agency arrived at the penalty figure it has agreed to accept in settlement.</text>
        </para>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>(2)</num>
        <text>The methodology for these calculations will differ only in that no downward adjustments (other than those reflecting a violator's good faith efforts to comply with applicable requirements) will usually be included in the calculation of the proposed penalty for the administrative complaint. In those instances where the violator or reliable information demonstrates prior to the issuance of the complaint that applying further downward adjustment factors (over and above those reflecting a violator's good faith efforts to comply) is appropriate, enforcement personnel may in their discretion (but are not required to) make such further downward adjustments in the amount of the penalty proposed in the complaint.</text>
      </para>
      <annotations/>
    </section>
    <section>
      <num>40.1709</num>
      <heading>Considerations for Determining Penalty</heading>
      <text>In determining the amount of the penalty to be included in the complaint, enforcement personnel should consider all possible ramifications posed by the violation and resolve any doubts (e.g., as to the application of adjustment factors or the assumptions underlying the amount of the economic benefit enjoyed by the violator) against the violator in a manner consistent with the facts and findings so as to preserve TMBCI/EPA ability to litigate for the strongest penalty possible. It should be noted that assumptions underlying any upward adjustments or refusal to apply downward adjustments in the penalty amount are subject to revision later as new information becomes available. In civil judicial cases, TMBCI/EPA will use the narrative penalty assessment criteria set forth in the Policy to explain the penalty amount agreed to in settlement.</text>

      <heading>Multiple and Multi-Day (Continuing) Violation Calculations</heading>
      <text>The Policy also explains how to factor into the calculation of the gravity based component the presence of multiple and multi-day (continuing) violations.</text>
      <text>The amount of economic benefit from noncompliance gained by the violator will be calculated and added to the gravity-based penalty amount. After the appropriate gravity-based penalty amount (including the multi-day component) has been determined, it may be adjusted upward or downward to reflect particular circumstances surrounding the violation. The amount of any economic benefit enjoyed by the violator is not subject to adjustment.</text>

      <text>This document sets forth the TMBCI/EPA Policy and internal guidelines for determining penalty amounts that: (1) should be sought in administrative actions filed under the SHWMC and (2) would be acceptable in settlement of administrative and judicial enforcement actions under the SHWMC.</text>
      <text>Note: This Policy does not limit the penalty amount that may be sought in tribal civil judicial actions. In tribal civil judicial actions the TMBCI may, in its discretion, continue to file complaints requesting a civil penalty up to the maximum amount, and may litigate for the maximum amount justifiable on the facts of the case.</text>

        <text>intended to ensure that compliance is expeditiously achieved and maintained This Policy does not address whether assessment of a civil penalty is the correct enforcement response to a particular violation. Rather, this Policy focuses on determining the proper civil penalty amount that the TMBCI/EPA should obtain once a decision has been made that a civil penalty amounts for the purposes of administrative enforcement actions, under appropriate circumstances, TMBCI/EPA personnel may apply the maximum penalty.</text>

        <text>Documentation for penalty sought in administrative legislation: In order to support the penalty proposed in the administrative enforcement action, enforcement personnel must include in the case file an explanation of how the proposed penalty amount was calculated. As a sound case management practice in administrative cases, a case "record" file should document or reference all factual information on which the TMBCI/EPA Compliance officer will need to rely to support the penalty amount sought in the enforcement action. Full documentation of the reasons and rationale for the penalty complaint amount is important to expeditious, successful administrative enforcement of RCRA violations. The documentation should include all relevant information and documents which served as the basis for the penalty complaint amount and were relied upon by the Director of the TMBCI/EPA. In general, only final documents, but not preliminary documents, such as drafts and internal memoranda reflecting earlier deliberations, should be included in the record file. All documentation supporting the penalty calculation should be in the record file at the time the complaint is issued. The documentation should be supplemented to include a justification for any adjustment to the penalty amount in the complaint made after initial issuance of the complaint, if such adjustments are necessary.</text>

The record supporting the penalty amount specified in the complaint should include a penalty computation worksheet which explains the potential for harm, extent of deviation from Tribal regulatory requirements, economic benefit of noncompliance, and any adjustment factors applied (e.g., good faith efforts to comply). An example of the worksheet is attached in the Appendix to this Policy. Also, the record should include any inspection reports and other documents relating to the penalty calculation.</text>

      <heading>Documentation of Penalty Settlement Amount</heading>
      <text>Until settlement discussions or the pre-hearing information exchanges occur with the respondent, mitigating and equitable factors and overall strength of the TMBCI/EPA enforcement case may be difficult to assess. Accordingly, preparation of a penalty calculation worksheet for purposes of establishing the TMBCI/EPA settlement position on penalty amount may not be feasible prior to the time that negotiations with the violator commence. Once the violator has presented to the TMBCI/EPA with its best arguments relative to penalty mitigation, the TMBCI/EPA may, at its discretion, complete and document a penalty calculation to establish its initial "bottom line" settlement position. However, at a minimum, prior to final approval of any settlement, whether administrative or judicial, enforcement personnel should complete a final worksheet and narrative explanation of the penalty calculation summary which provides the rationale for the final settlement amount to be included in the case file. As noted above, enforcement personnel may, in arriving at a penalty settlement amount, deviate significantly from the penalty amount sought in an administrative complaint, provided such discretion is exercised in accordance with the provisions of this Policy.</text>

      <text>The Tribal Administrative Procedures Act (TAPA) for administrative proceedings shall be utilized by the TMBCI/EPA to include a specific proposed penalty in the complaint or at a later specified time. The TMBCI/EPA shall provide the respondent with an explanation of how the penalty was calculated in accordance with any criteria set forth in the TAPA. This Policy requires that enforcement personnel calculate a proposed penalty (and include this amount and the underlying rationale for adopting it either in methodology for calculating penalty amounts which would be acceptable to the Tribal Court in settlement of administrative and judicial enforcement actions. The dollar amount of the proposed penalty that will be sought in the administrative hearing may exceed the amount of the penalty the Agency would accept in settlement. This may be so for several reasons:</text>
      <para>
        <num>1.</num>
        <text>At the time the complaint is filed, the TMBCI/EPA will often not be aware of mitigating factors (then known only to the respondent) on the basis of which the penalty may be adjusted downward.</text>

        <text>It is appropriate that the TMBCI/EPA have the enforcement discretion to accept in settlement a lower penalty than it has sought (in its complaint, because in settling a case the TMBCI/EPA is able to avoid the costs and</text>
        <text>risks of litigation. Moreover, respondents must perceive that they face some significant risk of higher penalties through litigation to have appropriate incentives to agree to penalty amounts acceptable to the TMBCI/EPA in settlement.</text>

This total should then be added to the amount of any economic benefit accruing to the violator. The result will e the proposed penalty the TMBCI/EPA will seek in the administrative proceeding.</text>

      <text>In judicial actions, it will generally only be necessary to calculate a penalty amount to support any penalty the TMBCI/EPA is to accept in settlement. Counsel for the Tribe may point out to the court in judicial actions that the penalty figure it seeks is consistent with the rationale underlying the Penalty Policy. However, counsel should not suggest that the court is bound to follow the Policy in assessing a civil penalty. Judicial officers have discretion to apply most of the upward or downward adjustment factors described in this Policy in determining what penalty should be imposed on a violator. However, judgments as to whether a penalty should be reduced in settlement because:</text>

      <heading>Potential for Harm</heading>
      <text>The SHWMC was adopted in order to prevent harm to human health and the environment. Thus, noncompliance with any requirement of the SHWMC can result in a situation where there is a potential for harm to human health or the environment. In addition to those violations that involve actual or potential contamination from the release of hazardous wastes or substances, violations such as failure to comply with recordkeeping requirements create a risk of harm to the environment or human health as well as undermine the integrity of the Tribal regulatory program. Accordingly, the assessment of the potential for harm resulting from a violation should be based on two factors:</text>
      <para>
        <num>1.</num>
        <text>the risk of human or environmental exposure to hazardous waste and/or hazardous constituents that may be posed by noncompliance, and</text>

      <text>The risk of exposure presented by a given violation depends on both the likelihood that human or other environmental receptors may be exposed to hazardous waste and/or hazardous substances and the degree of such potential exposure. Evaluating the risk of exposure may be simplified by considering the factors which follow below.</text>

        <num>1.</num>
        <text>Probability of Exposure: Where a violation involves the actual management of waste, a penalty should reflect the probability that the violation could have resulted in, or has resulted in a release of waste or waste constituents, or hazardous conditions posing a threat of exposure to waste or waste constituents.

        </para>
        <text>In considering the risk of exposure, the emphasis is placed on the potential for harm posed by a violation rather than on whether harm actually occurred. Violators rarely have any control over whether their pollution actually causes harm. Therefore, such violators should not be rewarded with lower penalties simply because the violations did not result in actual harm.</text>
        <text>In considering this factor, the environmental sensitivity of the receptor areas or populations should be examined. The risk of exposure to a particularly sensitive environmental area, such as a wetland, a drinking water source, or the habitat of a threatened or endangered species, may be a basis for an upward adjustment of the category chosen for the potential harm (i.e., minor to moderate, moderate to major) or a selection of a higher amount in the range of the chosen penalty matrix cell.</text>

      <heading>Harm to the Tribal Regulatory Program</heading>
      <text>There are some requirements of the SHWMC which, if violated, may not appear to give rise as directly or immediately to a significant risk of contamination as other requirements. Noncompliance with these requirements, however, directly increases the threat of harm to human health and the environment. Therefore, all regulatory requirements are fundamental to the continued integrity of the SHWMC. Violations of such requirements may have serious implications and merit substantial penalties where the violation undermines the regulatory purposes or procedures for implementing the SHWMC. Some examples of this kind of regulatory harm include:</text>
      <para>

        <text>failure to submit a timely/adequate permit application;</text>

In determining the extent of the deviation, the    following    categories    should    be     used:   MAJOR: The violator deviates from requirements of the regulation to such an extent that most (or important aspects) of the requirements are not met resulting	in	substantial	noncompliance. MODERATE: The violator significantly deviates from the requirements of the regulation but some of the requirements are implemented as intended.

      <text>The lowest cell (minor potential for harm/minor extent of deviation) contains a penalty range from $20 to $200. The highest cell (major potential for harm/major extent of deviation) is limited by the maximum penalty allowance of $5,000 per day for each violation.</text>
      <text>Note that all references in this Policy to matrix cells consist of the Potential for Harm factor followed by the Extent of Deviation factor (e.g., major potential for harm/moderate extent of deviation is referred to as major/moderate).</text>
      <text>The range of numbers provided in each matrix cell serves as a "fine tuning" device to allow enforcement personnel to better adapt the penalty amount to the gravity of the violation and its surrounding circumstances. Enforcement personnel should analyze and rely on case-specific factors in selecting a dollar figure from this range. Such factors include the seriousness of the violation (relative to other violations falling within the same matrix cell), the environmental sensitivity of the areas potentially threatened by the violation, efforts at remediation or the degree of cooperation evidenced by the facility (to the extent this factor is not to be accounted for in subsequent adjustments to the penalty amount), the size and sophistication of the violator, the number of days of violation, and other relevant matters.</text>
      <text>For some continuing violations, it is possible that circumstances may change during the period of violation in some manner that could affect the Potential for Harm or Extent of Deviation determinations. Enforcement personnel may choose difficult matrix cells for different periods of the same violation.  For example, for a violation that lasts for 100 days, the circumstances during the first 50 days may warrant a penalty from the major/major cell. On day 51, if the violator takes affirmative steps to come into compliance or otherwise address the noncompliance but does not completely end the violation, the Potential for Harm or Extent of Deviation may change enough to</text>
      <text>Page 47 of 71</text>
      <text>December 2012</text>
      <text>warrant a different category (i.e., moderate or minor). In such a case, enforcement personnel should calculate separate penalties for the distinct periods of violation. This adjustment only applies where actions of the violator change the circumstances; natural attenuation or other natural changes in the circumstances should not result in this type of bifurcated penalty calculation.</text>
      <text>When considering the sophistication of the violator, enforcement personnel may presume, in the absence of information to the contrary, that entities such as small organizations and small business do not possess the same level of sophistication as other regulated entities. This presumption should, in most circumstances, result in a lower penalty amount than would otherwise be selected for similar violations.</text>

        <text>Multiple Violations Criteria: In certain situations, the TMBCI/EPA may find that a facility has violated several different requirements. A separate penalty should be proposed in an administrative proceeding and obtained in settlement or litigation for each separate violation that results from an independent act (or failure to act) by the violator and is substantially distinguishable from any other claim in the complaint for which a penalty is to be assessed. A given claim is independent of, and substantially distinguished from, any other claim when it requires an element of proof not needed by the others. In many cases, violations of different sections of the regulations constitute independent and substantially distinguishable violations. For litigation or settlement purposes, each of the violations should be assessed separately and the amounts added to determine a total penalty to pursue. It is also possible that different violations of the same section of the regulations could constitute independent and substantially distinguishable violations. For penalty purposes, each of the violations should be assessed separately and the amounts totaled.</text>
        <text>Penalties for multiple violations also should be sought in litigation or obtained in settlement where one party or person has violated the same requirement in substantially different locations. An example of this type of violation is failure to clean up discharged waste during transportation. A transporter who did not clean up waste discharged in two separate locations during the same trip should be charged with two counts. In these situations, the separate penalty assessments are justified. Similarly, penalties for multiple violations are appropriate when a party or person violates the same requirement on separate occasions but not as multi-day violations. An example would be the case where the facility fails for a year to submit required quarterly reports. For penalty purposes, each failure to report during the year, which is four total violations, should be assessed separately.</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>2.</num>
        <text>Compression of Penalties for Related Violations: In general, penalties for multiple violations may be less likely to be appropriate where the violations are not independent or not substantially distinguishable. Where a claim derives from or merely restates another claim, a separate penalty may not be warranted. For example, if an owner/operator of a waste management facility submitted a permit application with a cover letter, signed by the manager's secretary, but failed to sign the permit application, and also thereby failed to have the appropriate responsible person sign the application, the owner/operator has violated the requirement that the application be signed by a responsible company official. The</text>
        <text>TMBCI/EPA has the discretion to view the violations resulting from the same factual event, failure to sign the application at all, and failure to have the person legally responsible for the permit application sign the application at all, and failure to have the person resulting from the same factual event, failure to sign the application at all, and failure to have the person legally responsible for the permit application sign it, as posing one legal risk. In this situation, both sections violated should be cited in the complaint, but one penalty, rather than two, may be appropriate to pursue in litigation or obtain in settlement, depending upon the facts of a case. The fact that two separate sections were violated may be taken into account in choosing higher "potential for harm" and "extent of deviation" categories on the penalty matrix.</text>
        <text>In cases such as these where multiple violations result from a single initial transgression, assessment of a separate penalty for each distinguishable violation may produce a total penalty which is disproportionately high. Accordingly, in the specifically limited circumstances described, enforcement personnel have discretion to forego separate gravity-based and multi-day penalties for certain distinguishable violations, so long as the total penalty for all related violations is appropriate considering the gravity of the offense and is sufficient to deter similar   future   behavior   and   recoup   economic   benefit.   In deciding which penalties should be compressed (i.e., the violations for which separate penalties should not be calculated), enforcement personnel should consider the seriousness of the violation, the importance of the underlying requirement to the regulatory scheme, and the economic benefit resulting from each violation. Violations that involve substantial noncompliance or that result in economic benefit that should be recaptured, should be set forth separately in the complaint. Even where separate penalties are not calculated for distinguishable violations, all significant violations should still be cited separately in the complaint to demonstrate the magnitude and scope of the violations. [Citation 21] The recitation of all significant violations will provide further support for a penalty that is based on a risk of harm and extent of deviation for the totality of the violations.</text>

        <text>Multiple Violations Treated as Multi-day Violations: Multiple violations are appropriate where the TMBCI/EPA can demonstrate that independent and independent and substantially distinguishable violations have occurred. Violations should be treated as multi-day violations (one penalty with a multi-day component) where the same violation continues uninterrupted for more than one day.</text>
        <text>Where a facility has through a series of independent acts or omissions repeatedly violated the same statutory or regulatory requirement, the violations may begin to closely resemble multi-day violations in their number and similarity to each other. This is particularly true where the violations occur within close proximity in time to each other and are based on similar acts by the violator. In these circumstances, enforcement personnel have discretion to treat each violation after the first in the series as multi-day violations (assessable at the rates provided in the multi-day matrix), if to do so would produce a more equitable penalty calculation. For example, if a facility fails to submit four quarterly reports in the same year, the TMBCI/EPA may treat these as four separate violations. However, if a facility is required to conduct daily inspections but fails to do so for an entire month or longer, the TMBCI/EPA may calculate the penalty utilizing the multi-day matrix. In those cases where a series of recurring, separate violations are treated as multi-day violations, enforcement personnel should treat each occurrence as one day for purposes of calculating the multi-day component.</text>

        <text>The SHWMC provides the TMBCI/EPA with the authority to assess in administrative actions or seek in court civil penalties of up to $5,000.00 per day of non-compliance for each violation of a requirement of the SHWMC. Any such penalty assessed should consist of a gravity-based component, economic benefit component, and to the extent that violations can be shown or presumed to have continued for more than one day, an appropriate multi-day component. The multi-day component should reflect the duration of the violation at issue, subject to the guidelines set forth in Section VII C., below.</text>

      <para>
        <num>2.</num>
        <text>After it has been determined that any of the violations alleged has continued for more than a day, the next step is to determine the length of time each violation continued and whether a multi-day penalty is mandatory, presumed, or discretionary. In most instances, the TMBCI/EPA should only seek to obtain multi-day penalties. If a multi-day penalty is appropriate, for the number of days it can document that the violation in question persisted. However, in some circumstances, reasonable assumptions as to the duration of a violation can be made. For example, in the case where an inspection reveals that a facility has no groundwater monitoring wells in place it can be assumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the facility has never had any wells. Here the violation can be treated as having commenced on the day that the permit triggered the requirements began or the effective date of the regulations, whichever is later. A multi-day penalty could then be calculated for the entire period from the date the facility was required to have wells in place until the date of the inspection showing they did not.</text>

      <para>
        <num>3.</num>
        <text>Conversely, in cases where there is no permit or regulatory deadline from which it may be assumed compliance obligations began to run, a multi-day penalty should account only for each day for which information provides a reasonable basis for concluding that a violation has occurred. Where EPA determines that a violation persists, enforcement personnel may calculate the penalty for a period ending on the date of compliance or the date the complaint is filed or, if the complaint references only the statutory maximum, the date the proposed penalty is submitted.</text>

        <text>If the calculation is based on the date the complaint is filed, and if the violation continues after that date, the complaint should include language stating that the TMBCI/EPA may amend the complaint because the violation may continue to occur after filing. For example, the complaint could state:</text>
        <text>The violation alleged in Count 1 of this complaint is of a continuing nature and continues, to the best of the TMBCI/EPA knowledge and belief, as of the date of the filing of this complaint. The TMBCI/EPA, therefore, reserves the right to amend this complaint and the penalty proposed herein to reflect additional days of violation for the violation alleged in Count 1.</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>5.</num>
        <text>Alternatively, enforcement personnel may consider including language in the complaint stating that the penalty will include a specific, additional</text>
        <text>per day amount until the violation is corrected. The language of the complaint should be clear that the amount chosen is based on the circumstances as they are known at the time the complaint is filed and that if the conditions change, the amount of the penalty sought may change.    For    example, the     complaint     could     state: "The violation alleged in Count 1 of this complaint is of a continuing nature and continues, to the best of the TMBCI/EPA knowledge and belief, as of the date of the filing of this complaint.

      <text>As discussed above, this Penalty Policy permits the TMBCI/EPA to waive or reduce multi-day penalties, when otherwise mandatory for a violation, in a "highly unusual case."

      <heading>Effect of Economic Benefit of Noncompliance</heading>
      <text>This Policy encourages the recapture of any significant economic benefit of non-compliance that accrues to a violator from non-compliance with the SHWMC. Enforcement personnel shall evaluate the economic benefit of noncompliance when penalties are calculated. The fundamental premise of this Policy is that economic incentives for noncompliance are to be eliminated. If, after the penalty is paid, violators still profit by violating the law, there is little incentive to comply. Therefore, it is incumbent on all enforcement personnel to calculate economic benefit. An "economic benefit" component should be calculated and added to the gravity-based penalty component when a violation results in "significant" economic benefit to the violator. Economic benefit can result from a violator delaying or avoiding compliance costs, or when the violator achieves an illegal competitive advantage through its non- compliance.</text>
      <text>The total economic benefit amount (all violations added together) should be compared to the chart to determine whether an economic benefit component should be included in the proposed penalty. Any decision not to seek an economic benefit penalty and the rationale for such a decision should be documented on the Penalty Computation Worksheet.</text>

      <heading>Calculation of Economic Benefit from Delayed and Avoided Costs</heading>
      <text>Enforcement personnel may use the rule of thumb approach whenever the economic benefit penalty is not substantial (generally under $10,000) and use of an expert financial witness may not be warranted. This can be a simple matter of determining the local avoided costs of compliance.</text>
      <text>For economic benefit penalties that are more substantial (generally more than</text>
      <text>$10,000), enforcement personnel should use an expert financial witness or seek the assistance of other enforcement agencies.</text>
      <text>The economic benefit component should be calculated initially for the maximum period of noncompliance. Enforcement personnel should then determine whether that amount should be reduced for any reasons. However, enforcement personnel should be prepared to support the calculation of economic benefit for the entire period of noncompliance if there is any uncertainty regarding potential reductions that may have been identified.</text>
      <text>The economic benefit calculation should also take into account the entire period that a violator enjoys the benefit. In almost all cases, the violator will enjoy the financial benefit until the economic benefit penalty is paid. Therefore, this calculation should be based on a penalty payment date corresponding roughly with the relevant hearing date. At the hearing, TMBCI/EPA personnel should be prepared to inform the Presiding Officer that the violator will continue to enjoy the economic benefit until the penalty is paid and the relevant time period should include any time periods after the hearing prior to penalty payment.</text>

      <heading>Additional Information on Economic Benefit</heading>
      <text>In addition to delayed and avoided costs, an economic benefit may accrue to a violator in the form of an illegal competitive advantage. In this type of economic benefit, the illegal activity results in a financial gain that the violator would not otherwise realize if the violation had not been committed. In most cases, a violating facility will realize either benefits from delayed/avoided costs or from an illegal competitive advantage; however, where the circumstances support it, any penalty amount based on benefits due to illegal competitive advantage should be added to any other type of economic benefit that has been calculated.</text>
      <text>An example of an illegal competitive advantage would be a waste hauler that charges a lower fee for his services due to avoidance of full tipping fees at a landfill due to illegally dumping portions of the waste loads prior to legal disposal at the landfill.</text>

        <text>Adjustment Factors. Background: As mentioned in Section VI of this document, the seriousness of the violation is considered in determining the gravity-based penalty component. The reasons the violation was committed, the intent of the violator, and other factors related to the violator are not considered in choosing the appropriate cell from the matrix. However, any systems for calculating penalties must have enough flexibility to make adjustments that reflect legitimate differences between separate violations of the same provision. In assessing penalties, the TMBCI/EPA must take into account any good faith efforts to comply with the applicable requirements. There are several such adjustment factors to consider. These include the degree of willfulness and/or negligence, history of noncompliance, ability to pay, and other unique factors. This adjustment may also include an additional adjustment factor for environmental projects undertaken by the violator, and that are not to the</text>

      <para>
        <num>2.</num>
        <text>Recalculation of Penalty Amount: If new information becomes available after the issuance of the proposed penalty which makes it clear that the initial calculation of the penalty is in error, enforcement personnel should adjust this figure. Enforcement personnel should document on the Penalty Computation Worksheet the basis for recalculating the gravity- based or economic benefit component of the penalty. For example, if after the issuance of the proposed penalty, information is presented which indicates that less waste is involved than was believed when the proposed penalty was issued, it may be appropriate to recalculate the gravity-based penalty component. Thus, if enforcement personnel had originally believed that the violator had improperly stored ten barrels of hazardous wastes but it was later determined that only a single container of hazardous waste was improperly stored, it may be appropriate to recalculate the "potential for harm" component of the gravity-based penalty from "major" to "moderate" or "minor." On the other hand, if enforcement personnel initially believed a violator had fully complied with a specified requirement but subsequently determine that this is not the case, it would be appropriate to amend the complaint as necessary to add a new count, and revise the total penalty amount upward to account for this previously undiscovered violation. Likewise, if new information shows that a previously known violation is more serious than initially thought, an upward revision of the penalty amount may be required. Furthermore, if the violator presented new information which established that the work performed was technically inadequate or useless (e.g., the violator drilled wells in the wrong spot or did not dig deep enough), it may be more appropriate to keep the gravity-based penalty as originally calculated an evaluate whether it would be appropriate to mitigate the penalty based on the "good faith efforts" adjustment factor. When information is presented which makes it clear that the gravity-based or economic benefit penalty component is in error, enforcement personnel may, of course, choose to formally amend the complaint to correct the original penalty component. In all instances, any recalculation of the penalty should be carefully documented on the Penalty Computation Worksheet and include a summary in the enforcement file.</text>

        <text>Application of Adjustment Factors: The adjustment factors can increase, decrease or have no effect on the penalty amount sought from the violator. Adjustments should generally be applied to the sum of the gravity-based and multi-day components of the penalty for a given violation. All supportable upward adjustments of the penalty amount of which the TMBCI/EPA is aware ordinarily should be made prior to issuance of the proposed penalty, while downward adjustments (with the exception of those reflecting good faith efforts to comply) should generally not be made until after the proposed should be placed on the violator. Enforcement personnel should use whatever reliable information on the violator and violation is readily available at the time of assessment.</text>
        <text>However, if a penalty is to achieve deterrence, both the violator and the general public must be convinced that the penalty places the violator in a worse position than those who have complied in a timely fashion. Moreover, allowing a violator to benefit from noncompliance punishes those who have complied.</text>

          <text>Good Faith Efforts to Comply/Lack of Good Faith.</text>
          <text>Good faith efforts to comply with applicable requirements must be considered in assessing a penalty. The violator can manifest good faith by promptly identifying and reporting noncompliance or instituting measures to remedy the violation before the TMBCI/EPA detects the violation. Assuming self-reporting is not required by law and the violations are expeditiously corrected, a violator's admission or correction of a violation prior to detection may provide a basis    for</text>

      <text>mitigation of the penalty, particularly where the violator institutes significant new measures to prevent recurrence. Lack of good faith, on the other hand, can result in an increased penalty. Likewise, claims by a violator that "it was not told" by the Tribe, the TMBCI/EPA or the Compliance Officer that it was out of compliance should not be cause for any downward adjustment of the penalty.</text>

        <text>Degree of Willfulness and/or Negligence.</text>
        <text>In cases where civil penalties are sought for "knowing" violations of the Tribal Laws/Code(s), the penalty may be adjusted upward for willfulness and/or negligence.</text>
        <text>In assessing the degree of willfulness, and/or negligence, the following factors should be considered, as well as any others deemed appropriate:</text>
        <para>
          <num>(1)</num>
          <text>how much control the violator had over the events	constituting the violation;</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <num>(2)</num>
          <text>the foreseeability of the events constituting a violation;</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <num>(3)</num>
          <text>whether the violator took reasonable precautions against the events constituting the violation;</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <num>(4)</num>
          <text>whether the violator knew or should have known of the hazards associated with the conduct; and</text>

        <para>
          <num>(5)</num>
          <text>whether the violator knew or should have known of the requirement which was violated.</text>
          <text>It should be noted that this last factor, lack of knowledge of the requirement, should never be used as a basis to reduce the penalty. To do so would encourage ignorance of the law. Rather, knowledge of the Tribal law/code(s) should serve only  to  enhance  the  penalty.  The amount of control which the violator had over how quickly the violation was remedied also is relevant in certain circumstances. Specifically, if correction of the environmental problem was delayed by factors which the violator can clearly show were not reasonably foreseeable and were out of his or her control and the control of his or her agents, the penalty may be reduced.</text>

        <text>History of Noncompliance (upward adjustment only) where a party previously has violated Tribal environmental laws/code(s)at the same time or a different site, this is usually clear evidence that the party was not deterred by the previous enforcement response. Unless the current or previous violation was caused by factors entirely out of the control of the violator, this is an indication that the penalty should be adjusted upwards.</text>
        <text>Some of the factors that enforcement personnel should consider in making this determination are as follows:</text>
        <para>
          <num>a.</num>
          <text>how similar the previous violation was;</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <num>b.</num>
          <text>how recent the previous violation was;</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <num>c.</num>
          <text>the number of previous violations; and</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <num>d.</num>
          <text>violator's response to previous violation(s) in regard to correction of problem.</text>
          <text>A violation generally should be considered "similar" if the TMBCI/EPA previous enforcement response should have alerted the party to a particular type of compliance problem. A previous violation of the same requirement   would   constitute    a    similar    violation. Nevertheless, a history of noncompliance can be established even in the absence of similar violations, where there is a pattern of disregard of environmental requirements contained in Tribal or another federal environmental statute. Enforcement personnel should examine multimedia compliance by the respondent and, where there are indications of a history of noncompliance, the penalty  should  be  adjusted  accordingly.     For the purpose of <cite path="40|40.17|40.1745">this section</cite>, a "previous violation" includes any act or omission for which a formal or informal enforcement response has occurred (e.g., Tribal, EPA or State notice of violation, warning letter,</text>
        </para>
      </para>
      <text>Page 55 of 71</text>
      <text>December 2012</text>
      <text>complaint, consent agreement, final order, or consent decree). The term also includes any act or omission for which the violator has previously been given written notification or warning, however informal, that the TMBCI/EPA believes a violation exists.</text>
      <para>
        <num>5.</num>
        <text>Ability to Pay (downward adjustment only): The TMBCI/EPA generally will not assess penalties that are clearly beyond the means of the violator. Therefore, the enforcement personnel should consider the ability of a violator to pay a penalty. At the same time, it is important that the regulated community not see the violation of environmental requirements as a way of aiding a financially-troubled business.</text>
        <text>Enforcement personnel should conduct a preliminary inquiry into the financial status of the party against whom a proposed penalty is being assessed. This inquiry may include a review of publicly-available information. The ability of a violator to pay a proposed penalty is not a factor that the TMBCI/EPA must consider in assessing a penalty. However, because this is a mitigating factor set forth in this Policy, enforcement personnel should be generally aware of the financial status of the violator in the event that this is raised as an issue in settlement or hearing.</text>
        <text>The burden to demonstrate inability to pay rests on the violator, as it does with any mitigating circumstances. Thus, a person or party's inability to pay usually will be considered only if the issue is raised by the violator. If the violator fails to fully provide sufficient information, then enforcement personnel should disregard this factor in adjusting the penalty. When the TMBCI/EPA determines that a violator cannot afford the penalty as prescribed by this Policy or the cost of compliance or from carrying out remedial measures which the TMBCI/EPA deems to be more important than the deterrence effect of the penalty (e.g., payment of penalty would preclude proper clean up of a release), the following options should be considered in the order presented:</text>
        <para>
          <num>a.</num>
          <text>consider an installment payment plan with interest;</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <num>b.</num>
          <text>consider a delayed payment schedule with interest (for example, such a schedule might even be contingent upon an increase in sales or some other indicator of improved business); or</text>

        <para>
          <num>d.</num>
          <text>consider other penalties provided for under the SHWMC.</text>
          <text>As indicated above, the amount of any downward adjustment of the penalty is dependent on the individual facts of the case regarding the financial capability of the violator and the nature of the violations at issue.</text>
        </para>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>6.</num>
        <text>Environment Projects (downward adjustment only): Under certain circumstances the TMBCI/EPA may consider adjusting the penalty amount downward in return for an agreement by the violator to undertake an appropriate environmentally beneficial project. Such a project should not directly benefit the violator or be in response to another order or enforcement action by the Tribe, the State or a Federal agency.</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>7.</num>
        <text>Other Unique Factors: This Policy allows an adjustment for factors which may arise on a case-by-case basis. When developing its  settlement position, the TMBCI/EPA should evaluate every penalty with a view toward the potential for protracted litigation and attempt to ascertain the maximum civil penalty the tribal court is likely to award if the case, considering, for example, the probability of proving violations, the probability that the Tribe's legal arguments will be accepted, the opportunities which exist to establish a useful precedent or send a signal to the regulated community, the availability and potential effectiveness  of the Tribe's evidence, including witnesses, and the potential strength  of the violator's equitable and legal defenses. Where the TMBCI/EPA determines that significant litigative risks exist, it may also take into account any disproportionate resource outlay involved in litigating a case that it might avoid by entering into a settlement. Downward adjustments of</text>
        <text>the proposed penalty for settlement purposes may be warranted depending on the TMBCI/EPA assessment of these litigation considerations. The extent of the adjustments will depend, of course, on the specific litigation considerations presented in any particular case.</text>
        <text>In addition to litigation risks, enforcement personnel can consider, for the purposes of an expedited settlement, the cooperation of the person or party throughout the compliance evaluation and enforcement process. Enforcement personnel may reduce the gravity-based portion of the penalty by as much as 10% considering the degree of cooperation and preparedness during the inspection, provision of access to records, responsiveness and expeditious provision of supporting documentation requested by the process. In addition to creating an incentive for cooperative behavior during the activities listed above, this adjustment factor further reinforces the concept that respondents face a significant risk of higher penalties in litigation than in settlement. This adjustment factor should only be considered in settlements agreed to in principle by the parties before the filing of the prehearing exchange of information.</text>
        <text>It is important to note the difference between a penalty adjustment for cooperative attitude and for good faith efforts to comply. While self- reporting and correction of violations qualify as good faith efforts, the cooperation and attitude of the violator throughout the investigation and enforcement process should be the focus under this factor. For example, a violator may qualify for the adjustment if it voluntarily provides information prior to the TMBCI/EPA use of investigative tools such as information request well in advance of the due date and otherwise cooperates fully, a downward adjustment may be appropriate. By contrast, this factor should not be applied to those cases where the violator indicates an interest in settlement and enters into negotiations but does not demonstrate other indications of cooperation. Generally, this adjustment factor should apply to those violators who demonstrates and maintain a high degree of willingness to work with the TMBCI/EPA regarding the investigation and resolution of violations.</text>
