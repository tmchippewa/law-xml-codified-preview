      <text>Any Indian found within the boundaries of the Turtle Mountain Indian reservation who is wanted by State authorities for a violation of State law committed outside the jurisdiction of the Turtle Mountain Tribal Court, and a warrant of arrest having been issued from a State court, may be arrested and taken into custody by Bureau of Indian Affairs or Tribal law enforcement personnel for prompt transfer to the appropriate enforcement agency. The arrest and removal of the fugitive will be accomplished in accordance with the procedure set forth herein: Copies of State warrants may be presented to the Agency Branch of Law and Order whereupon they will be recorded as to date and time received. The warrant will be promptly presented to the Tribal or Trial Court Judge of the Turtle Mountain Tribal Court for a review as to date, charge, and person named thereon, to determine its apparent validity. The Judge, after satisfying himself or herself as to the apparent validity of the warrant, will issue an order for the arrest of the alleged fugitive from justice.</text>
      <text>All Indians being taken into custody as provided in the preceding paragraph shall be taken by the police officer to the Turtle Mountain Tribal Court where the Judge shall hold a hearing to determine only whether the Indian person in custody and before the Court is the same person charged on the face of the warrant. An Indian may waive such hearing by executing a waiver of removal hearing and he will be promptly turned over to the custody of the appropriate State official. Where a State warrant is issued from a State other than the State wherein the Indian Court is located, the warrant should be presented to the Tribal Court by the Sheriff of the County in which the local sheriff of the out-of-state agency will extradite the wanted subject, the procedure governing the arrest of the wanted fugitive may be completed as in other cases. After a hearing, as provided in paragraph (2) above, if the Judge is named in the State warrant, the Tribal Court Judge shall issue an appropriate order to that effect which will authorize the State official to remove the fugitive from the Turtle Mountain Indian reservation. In all cases wherein Indians are arrested by reservation law and order personnel the requesting agency supplying the warrant shall be immediately notified that the subject is in custody and will be delivered to a proper official within a reasonable time to transfer the fugitive to their particular jurisdiction.</text>

The denial of the motion by the defendant for a directed verdict may be reviewed upon appeal to the Tribal Court of Appeals. A directed verdict of acquittal must be based upon the determination that there is no material fact to be determined by the jury, or even if there is any fact to be determined, that no reasonable person could conclude upon the evidence presented that the defendant is guilty.</text>
