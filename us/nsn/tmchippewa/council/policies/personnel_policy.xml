      <text>Hours of Work</text>
      <text>The standard tour of duty for tribal employees is five (5) days per week, Monday through Friday.  Core time is 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.  Employees are expected to work a full eight-hour day.  Two 15-minute breaks are allowed, one in the a.m. and one in the p.m. scheduled by the Supervisor.  Employees may flex their schedule between 7:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m.  with up to an hour for lunch with the approval of their supervisor.</text>
      <text>*Core time is when everyone must be available or on approved leave.</text>
      <text>In case of an unavoidable absence or delay, the employee is required to immediately inform his/her supervisor and/or Human Resource department.  Employees failing to call in when absent or delayed may be placed on Absent without Leave status and are subject to disciplinary action.  In the instance where the employee is a repeat offender, this will be grounds for termination.</text>
      <text>Part-time employees' schedules will be set by the Supervisor.  Failure to adhere to the set schedule will be cause for disciplinary action.</text>
      <text>If tour of duty requires other schedules/flex time arrangements etc., all time scheduled is considered the standard tour of duty.  (e.g., programs requiring shifts 24 hours per day).  The appropriate Supervisor along with concurrence from the Tribal Chairperson or his/her designee will authorize deviations from the normal schedule if necessary.</text>
      <text>If an employee is on unpaid leave for more than 16 hours, the employee will not accrue annual leave or sick leave for that pay period.  Leave for all tardiness will be calculated on a weekly basis and rounded to one half hour increments and charged in one half hour increments.</text>

They can also produce organizational and employee benefits, such as lower healthcare costs, increased productivity, improved recruitment and retention, reduced absenteeism and presenteeism, and enhanced employee engagement.  Worksite health and wellness strategies include but are not limited to, health education, nutrition services, lactation support, physical activity promotion, screenings, vaccinations, traditional occupational health and safety, disease management, and linkages to related employee services.  Tribal Government will develop programs that address the employees' current and future needs to produce the healthiest possible workforce.</text>
      <text>Employees will be granted a maximum of 30 minutes added to the lunch break for fitness and gardening at a hosting site.   Employees must make any necessary arrangements with supervisors and colleagues to ensure that the time does not interfere with workload or services provided by their department.

      <text>The tribe and all of its enterprises will provide a continued service of benefit's associated only with annual and sick leave.  Specifically, when an employee moves between entities, such as Tribal Government, Turtle Mountain Housing Authority, Sky Dancer Casino or Grand Treasure Casino, the employee's length of service leave benefits accrued at the employees beginning of employment site will transfer between the entities.  For example, if an employee has worked for the Turtle Mountain Housing Authority for 10 years and decides to apply for a position with Tribal Government, once the employee is hired their years of service will automatically qualify them for the entities policy on earning annual and sick leave.  Any employee's departure form one tribal entity must be in good standing in order for the leave benefit (years of service) to transfer with the employee.</text>

    <heading>Performance Appraisals and Review</heading>
    <text>Evaluation employee performance is a continuous process and integral part of the employee/supervisor relationship.  The TMBCI believes, therefore, that each employee should be regularly informed regarding his or her performance on the job.  To ensure that this appraisal is done as fairly and consistently as possible, the tribe will follow a system for periodically evaluating all employees.  This process will be monitored by the Human Resource department for consistency and effectiveness.</text>
    <text>The performance evaluation system provides a history of work progress of the individual employee with the tribe.  It shall also be utilized as a method to determine eligibility for merit increases, as a basis for discharging an employee and job status.  The Supervisor should use the performance evaluation system as a tool for counseling employees and as a communication tool for discussing work progress, problems, and opportunities.</text>

      <text>90-day Performance Evaluation</text>
      <text>All new employees will be evaluated at the conclusion their 90-day probationary period.  The Supervisor is responsible for completion of a formal 90-day evaluation of the employee's job performance.  If the Supervisor indicates that the employee's job performance is unacceptable or deficient the Supervisor may recommend dismissal within the 90-day probation period or 30 days after completion of the probationary period.</text>
      <text>Unforeseen circumstances may prevent and employee from adequate performance (E.g., death in the family, illness, or other major unforeseen matters).  In this case the Supervisor may extend the evaluation period an additional 30-days.  The Supervisor will inform the employee of any areas of responsibility that may be unacceptable or deficient.  After being notified of deficiencies, the employee must demonstrate that they can meet the minimum standard of performance.  If the employee does not demonstrate improvements in the unacceptable areas, the employee shall be subject to dismissal.  A copy of the evaluation will be kept by the employee, the Supervisor and one will be sent to the Human Resource department.  To be filed in the employee's personnel file.</text>

      <text>Annual Performance Evaluations</text>
      <text>Annual performance appraisal time frames begin on the start date of the employee in his/her current position and are due every year thereafter.  Therefore, it is imperative that Supervisors track and maintain the performance appraisal time frames of his/her evaluation date.</text>
      <text>Regular employees whose performance is below satisfactory, as determined by the annual performance review, will be indicated on the evaluation form.  The Supervisor will specify which job elements the employee needs to improve, recommendation for improvements, how the Supervisor will assist the employee to improve, and that employee will be re-evaluated, as determined by the Supervisor, at the end of six (6) months.  Failure by the employee to improve his/he performance will result in appropriate personnel action up to and including termination.</text>
      <text>The Supervisor should complete the evaluation form, sign it, and review it with the employee.  The employee will be asked to sign the evaluation form.  This signature indicates that the information has been communicated and does not necessarily indicate agreement.  If employee refuses to sign the document, the Supervisor will note that the employee refused to sign.  The employee will receive a copy of the evaluation and the original will be placed in the employee's personnel file.</text>
      <text>Employees who disagree with their evaluation may attach to the evaluation a written rebuttal.  The written rebuttal will be placed in the employee's personnel file along with the annual evaluation.</text>
